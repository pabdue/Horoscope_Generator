# Horoscope_Generator
# Utilized python modules to create a Zodiac/Horoscope generator based on user's birthday
# This program uses three modules which include: PIL (Python Imaging Library), Tkinter (GUI), and pygames (music).
# In order to run the code you must have all files in the same folder.
# Once the user enters a birthday and clicks the button "DONE" then the program will check whether the input is a valid or not by using exception handling.
